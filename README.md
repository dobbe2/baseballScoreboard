# baseballScoreboard

A responsive, interactive baseball scoreboard.  Choose your favorite MLB teams, and go head to head choosing your pitches and swings.

This project is a great challenge in logic, and uses so many conditionals.  Baseball is an extremely complicated sport when it comes to how all the moving parts work.  I was inspired by watching the score board update on TV, and imagining all the functionality it would take to program something like that.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS including Grid Layout
- Javascript
- jQuery
- RapidAPI
- CSS grid was used for the scoreboard layout

## Known Bugs

- The API's collection of images that is used to get the MLB team logos is incomplete, and there are a few teams without images (Sorry Yankees Fans). 
- I reached out to the API owner to have the image files updated, hopefully the images will be posted soon
- Temporary workaround: There were 4 teams without Logos sent back.  I worked in a check to see if one of these teams where searched, I have local images to use so it doesn't return the "Image Not Found" placeholder.
