# baseballScoreboard

An responsive, interactive baseball scoreboard.  Choose your favorite MLB teams, and go head to head choosing your pitches and swings.

This project is a great challenge in logic, and uses so many conditionals.  Baseball is an extremely complicated sport when it comes to how all the moving parts work.  I was inspired by watching the score board update on TV, and imagining all the functionality it would take to program something like that.
